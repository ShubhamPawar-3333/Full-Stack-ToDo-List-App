# Todo List Application Requirements

## Overview
The Todo List application is a full-stack web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks. It includes user authentication to manage personal task lists, ensuring secure and personalized access. The application is designed to be enterprise-grade, focusing on scalability, security, and maintainability.

## Functional Requirements
1. **User Authentication**
   - Users can register with a username and password.
   - Users can log in to access their personal task list.
   - Users can log out securely.
   - Passwords are hashed and stored securely.
2. **Task Management (CRUD Operations)**
   - Create: Users can create tasks with a title, description, and status (e.g., pending, completed).
   - Read: Users can view a list of their tasks or a single task's details.
   - Update: Users can edit task details (title, description, status).
   - Delete: Users can delete tasks.
3. **User Interface**
   - A responsive UI for task management, accessible on desktop and mobile.
   - Navigation between login, registration, and task management pages.
   - Client-side validation for task creation and user input forms.
4. **API Endpoints**
   - RESTful APIs for user authentication (`/auth/register`, `/auth/login`).
   - RESTful APIs for task CRUD operations (`/tasks`, `/tasks/{id}`).

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - The application should handle up to 100 concurrent users with response times under 2 seconds for API calls.
   - Database queries should be optimized for quick retrieval and updates.
2. **Security**
   - Implement JWT-based authentication for secure API access.
   - Protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
   - Use HTTPS for all communications in production.
3. **Scalability**
   - The backend should support horizontal scaling (e.g., via containerization with Docker).
   - The database should support efficient indexing and querying for growing datasets.
4. **Maintainability**
   - Codebase should follow clean code principles with modular design.
   - Comprehensive documentation for APIs and components.
   - Automated tests for backend and frontend to ensure reliability.
5. **Usability**
   - Intuitive UI with clear feedback (e.g., toast notifications for success/error).
   - Responsive design compatible with modern browsers and mobile devices.

## Assumptions
- Users have access to modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- The application will initially support English; localization is out of scope for the first release.
- Task data is stored persistently in a relational database (PostgreSQL).

## Constraints
- Development timeline: 12-16 weeks.
- Technology stack: React (frontend), Spring Boot (backend), PostgreSQL (database).
- Deployment on AWS for production.
