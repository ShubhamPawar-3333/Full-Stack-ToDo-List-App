# Todo List Application CI/CD Pipeline Plan

## Overview
The CI/CD pipeline for the Todo List application automates building, testing, and deploying the frontend (React) and backend (Spring Boot) using GitHub Actions. The pipeline ensures code quality, reliability, and rapid deployment to production (AWS) while adhering to DevOps best practices for an enterprise-grade application.

## Tools and Technologies
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions – Native integration with GitHub, flexible workflows, and free tier for small projects.
- **Build Tools**:
  - Frontend: npm (for React build and test).
  - Backend: Maven (for Spring Boot build and test).
- **Testing Frameworks**:
  - Frontend: Jest and React Testing Library.
  - Backend: JUnit and Mockito.
- **Deployment Target**: AWS (EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk for backend, S3/CloudFront for frontend).
- **Containerization**: Docker – For consistent build and deployment environments.
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch (to be configured in deployment phase).

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages
1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
   - Trigger: Push or pull request to `develop` or `feature/*` branches.
   - Steps:
     - **Checkout Code**: Pull the latest code from the repository.
     - **Frontend Build**: Run `npm install` and `npm build` in the `frontend` directory.
     - **Backend Build**: Run `mvn clean package` in the `backend` directory.
     - **Frontend Tests**: Run `npm test` for Jest unit and integration tests.
     - **Backend Tests**: Run `mvn test` for JUnit tests.
     - **Linting**: Run ESLint (frontend) and Checkstyle (backend) for code quality.
   - Artifacts: Store build outputs (e.g., `frontend/build`, `backend/target/*.jar`) for debugging.
2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**:
   - Trigger: Push to `main` branch (after PR approval and merge from `develop`).
   - Steps:
     - **Build Docker Images**: Create images for frontend (React static files) and backend (Spring Boot JAR).
     - **Push to Registry**: Push images to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
     - **Deploy Backend**: Deploy to AWS EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk using the Docker image.
     - **Deploy Frontend**: Deploy static files to AWS S3 and invalidate CloudFront cache.
     - **Verify Deployment**: Run smoke tests to ensure deployment success.
   - Rollback: Implement blue-green deployment to allow rollback on failure.

## Pipeline Configuration
- **GitHub Actions Workflows**:
  - A `ci.yml` workflow handles CI for both frontend and backend (build, test, lint).
  - A `cd.yml` workflow (to be added later) handles deployment to AWS.
- **Matrix Builds**: Use GitHub Actions matrix strategy to run frontend and backend jobs in parallel.
- **Secrets Management**: Store AWS credentials and other secrets in GitHub Secrets for secure deployment.
- **Caching**: Cache Node.js and Maven dependencies to speed up builds.

## DevOps Best Practices
- **Branch Protection**: Enforce PR reviews and passing CI checks for `main` and `develop` branches.
- **Code Quality**: Integrate ESLint, Prettier, and Checkstyle in the CI pipeline.
- **Test Coverage**: Generate coverage reports (Jest for frontend, JaCoCo for backend) and enforce minimum thresholds.
- **Environment Isolation**: Use separate environments (dev, staging, prod) with environment-specific configurations.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Integrate AWS CloudWatch for deployment monitoring (to be set up in deployment phase).
- **Documentation**: Maintain pipeline documentation in this file and update as workflows evolve.

## Initial CI Workflow
The initial `ci.yml` workflow (in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) focuses on building and testing both frontend and backend. It will be expanded for deployment in the deployment phase.

## Future Considerations
- Add end-to-end tests with Cypress or Playwright in the CI pipeline.
- Implement dependency scanning for security vulnerabilities (e.g., Dependabot).
- Add performance testing (e.g., JMeter) for load testing in the CD pipeline.
- Support multi-region deployments for high availability.
