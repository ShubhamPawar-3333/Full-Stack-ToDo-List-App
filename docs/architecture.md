# Todo List Application Architecture

## Overview
The Todo List application follows a client-server architecture with a React-based frontend, a Spring Boot backend, and a PostgreSQL database. The system is designed for scalability, security, and maintainability, adhering to enterprise-grade standards. The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs, secured with JWT-based authentication.

## Architecture Components
1. **Frontend (Client)**
   - **Technology**: React, TailwindCSS, Axios, React Router
   - **Purpose**: Provides a responsive user interface for task management and authentication.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Component-based UI for task lists, forms, and navigation.
     - Client-side state management using React Context or Redux Toolkit.
     - API calls to backend using Axios with JWT token handling.
     - Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
2. **Backend (Server)**
   - **Technology**: Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA
   - **Purpose**: Handles business logic, authentication, and data persistence.
   - **Key Features**:
     - RESTful APIs for task CRUD operations (`/tasks`) and authentication (`/auth`).
     - JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.
     - ORM with JPA for database interactions.
     - Input validation and error handling.
3. **Database**
   - **Technology**: PostgreSQL (H2 for local development)
   - **Purpose**: Stores user and task data persistently.
   - **Schema**:
     - `Users` table: Stores user information (id, username, password_hash).
     - `Tasks` table: Stores task details (id, title, description, status, user_id).
4. **Communication**
   - **Protocol**: HTTP/HTTPS with RESTful APIs.
   - **Security**: JWT tokens in Authorization headers for secure API access.
   - **CORS**: Configured to allow frontend access to backend APIs.

## Design Considerations
- **Scalability**: The backend can be containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS (e.g., EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk) for horizontal scaling. PostgreSQL supports clustering for database scaling.
- **Security**: Spring Security with JWT ensures secure authentication. HTTPS is enforced in production.
- **Maintainability**: Modular design with separated concerns (frontend components, backend services, database schema).
- **Performance**: Optimized database queries with indexing on `user_id` and `task_id`. Caching can be added later if needed.
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated builds, tests, and deployments. Docker Compose for local development.

## Assumptions
- The frontend runs on port 3000 (default for React), and the backend runs on port 8080 (default for Spring Boot).
- PostgreSQL is hosted on AWS RDS in production, with H2 used for local development.
- Initial deployment targets AWS for simplicity and scalability.

## Future Considerations
- Add API versioning for backward compatibility.
- Implement caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed tasks.
- Support for task categories or due dates in future iterations.
